## TODO

This project is still work in progress. Primarily used to study express and routing.
Currently the problem of not recieving filtered data based on user search query remains (data is accurately shown on server side as JSON but error
`NetworkError when attempting to fetch resource. occured TypeError`
remains on client side).
